<description>Mullets, and other kinds of legendary styles. Homeless people,  New Kids Turbo, Rednecks, and other fashion icons are here.

Recommended use with HAIR MODDING PLUS

I also have Pirated Hair pack (on Github) which contains hairs ripped from other mods, BECAUSE most of hair packs have stupid stuff which doesnt look good, so I chose only the good stuff that make characters look interesting.

List of mods you can disregard after installing my piracy mod is there to find.

After creating this hair pack i did cut my hair to mullet style. That was the best decicion i ever made in my entire life.</description>
